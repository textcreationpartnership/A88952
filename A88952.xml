         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Word of God grew mightily and prevailed.</hi> And it is not to be doubted, but that God will have the victory in the end: and the longer, and more eagerly any truth of his hath beene oppo≈øed and ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øt, the more ≈øuddenly and more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ≈øhall ≈øhe breake forth againe, to the amazement and confu≈øion of her Adver≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb facs="tcp:119829:6"/>and the ratification and rejoycing of her ≈øelfe and her profe≈ø≈øours. It is yeelded that this Tenet was Chri≈øtned in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and pure≈øt times: and that it had no meane Abettours for ≈øome ages after. And ≈øurely, a part thereof (and that ≈øuch a part which is a principal member of the whole) hath found beleevers among≈øt the mo≈øt learned of all times. But unle≈ø≈øe the Sunne ≈øhould depart, there could be no night: and unle≈ø≈øe this and many other Apo≈øtolicall truthes and cu≈øtomes, had by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle lo≈øt their credit in the Church, That man of ≈øin, That ≈øonne of perdition, That blinde leader of the blinde, could never with his trickes and trumpery have gained ≈øuch acceptance and advancement among≈øt men. And therefore I ≈øuppo≈øe, that that which was at fir≈øt a good advantage to him in his ri≈øing, and which is now his be≈øt plea for the upholding of his pompous Clergy, of his Princely and Magi≈øtracy-ma≈øtering Pontiffes; was, and is, the renouncing of the fore≈øaid truth, and thereupon the mi≈ø-application of all tho≈øe revelations which properly and naturally concerne the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and Re≈øtauration of the Jewes po≈øterity and Principality. So unhappily, ≈øo unwittingly may even good men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend, and make way for the cau≈øe they hate, when they faile to divide the Word of
<pb facs="tcp:119829:6"/>God aright; when they rob the Jew, the more to enrich the Gentile. Let us beware then, le≈øt our unbeleefe of the Jewes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption (of their<note n="(g)" place="margin">

                           </gap>.</hi> But it matters not much, which of the two is here ≈øpoken of: for ≈øeeing the Prophet doth plainely ≈øhew a future re≈øtoring of the Jewes, and yet the intent of the Apo≈øtle was onely to prove, that God had then called the Gentiles: it cannot otherwi≈øe be, but that the words [After this] in the Prophecy, being applyed to the fore≈øaid vi≈øiting of the Gentiles by the Preaching of the Go≈øpell, mu≈øt needes conclude; that the extraordinary re≈øtauration of the Jewes, fore≈øhewne by the Prophet, was to follow the calling of the Gentiles then begun by the Apo≈øtles: And con≈øequently, that the Jewes endevour to (1 <hi>The≈ø≈ø.</hi> 2 v. 14, 15.) hinder the growth of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpell, was a ≈øure proofe of the conver≈øion of the Gentiles, and their owne rejection. Who unto the death of Chri≈øt, were the peculiar people of God, and not wholly ca≈øt off, untill by their wilfull unbeliefe, they forced the Apo≈øtles to (<hi>Act.</hi> 13. v. 44, 45, 46.) turne from them to other Nations, to whom God had not formerly revealed him≈øelfe, and therefore could not at that time be ≈øaid, [to Returne] unto the Gentiles, whom he had but then received: no, nor to the Jewes, whom he had then (and not till then) quite for≈øaken. So that if we con≈øider the [Returning] of God here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Prophecy, to be appliable onely to the Jewes, to whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone God had ≈øo long before made him≈øelfe knowne; and yet that the Jewes were ≈øhortly after the calling of the Gentiles quite for≈øaken, we mu≈øt needs grant, that their great happine≈ø≈øe here foretold hath not beene yet enjoyd, but ≈øhall be, when the fulne≈ø≈øe of the ≈øuccedaneous Gentiles is come in. And wherefore did the Apo≈øtle change the Prophets, <hi>In that day will I rai≈øe up,</hi> into, <hi>After this I will returne and build?</hi> Wherfore, I ≈øay, did he, or rather the Holy Gho≈øt in him, make choyce of this Paraphra≈øe in place of the Text? if not of purpo≈øe to make that which hath been ≈øaid, the more planely appeare. To wit, that the day of the Jews deliverance, is to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wait the accompli≈øhment of the ≈øurrogated Gentiles vocation. For though this con≈øolatory Prophecy, according to the order of the things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to the Prophet, hath relation onely to a foregoing judgement de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced again≈øt the Jewes, yet it is not therefore mi≈ø-inferred here by the Apo≈øtle, as a ≈øub≈øequent too of the anticipated conver≈øion of the Gentiles, and that becau≈øe the very ≈øame time, which was foreappointed by God, for the execution of that puni≈øhment upon the for≈øaken Jewes, was al≈øo foreappointed by him, to be the time for the promulgation of his mercy, towards the ≈øub≈øtituted Gentiles; as the≈øe next words, <hi>That the re≈øidue of men might ≈øeeke after the Lord, and all the Gentiles upon whom my name is called,</hi> doe mo≈øt clearely intimate. For what is meant by the <hi>[Re≈øidue of men]</hi> but the remainder of tho≈øe Nations, which are not to be converted, till the fore≈øaid redemption of the Jewes? (their Redemption, I ≈øay, as well out of all Countries into which they are ≈øcattered, and from all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons among≈øt whom (as was foretold) they have beene ≈øifted (≈øo many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares) as from all their ≈øinnes, which moved God to u≈øe ≈øuch ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity towards them.) And what by the <hi>[Gentiles on whom Gods name is called]</hi> but the remuant of tho≈øe Nations, which are now already (or ≈øhall, if any more ≈øhall) while <hi>Davids Tabernacle layes wa≈øte,</hi> become the people of God in the hardned Jewes ≈øtead? So that this Prophecy doth as well prove a profe≈ø≈øion of the Go≈øpell, by a great part of the Gentiles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Jewes deliverance, and in the time of their blindne≈ø≈øe, as by all that are left of them afterwards; for that by a people on whom Gods name is called, or which is called by Gods Name, is to be under≈øtood, a people beloved of God, and called out from other Nations to ≈øerve him, as the Jewes were heretofore, and as the Chri≈øtians are now, I thinke none will deny; or that by the <hi>Re≈øidue of men, and all the Gentiles upon whom Gods name is called,</hi> all other Nations be≈øides the Jewes are meant. And was there then ever as yet ≈øuch an unanimous con≈øent in the true wor≈øhip of God, betwixt the Jewes and all other Nations as is here foretold? ≈øurely never betwixt them and any one Nation. No, nor long betwixt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves; and (the more the pitty) no le≈ø≈øe oddes hath a long time beene, and ≈øtill is among≈øt Chri≈øtians, both in their opinion and practi≈øe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious duties. <hi>Vide Commentationum Apocalyp. partem primam de ≈øigillis,</hi> pag. 55, 56,</note>

                  <p>One is, that the metaphor of the ≈øickle and the winepre≈ø≈øe, is us'd in the de≈øcription of no other overthrow but of this, <hi>I≈øa. chap.</hi> 63. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>Joel ch.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 19, 20. <hi>ch.</hi> 19. <hi>v.</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p>The other is, that (though the bodies both of the Jewes and Gentiles; yea of the good and bad, have beene often left as meat for the fowles of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, yet) the fowles are no way ≈øummond to eate the fle≈øh of men, by way of proclamation (which is a generall one too, and ≈øo argues the vi≈øitation to be the greater) but onely at the execution of this judgement, <hi>Ezek. chap.</hi> 39. <hi>ver≈ø.</hi> 17, 18, 19, 20. <hi>Rev. chap.</hi> 19. <hi>ver≈ø.</hi> 17, 18.</p>

Secondly, he ≈øuppo≈øeth, as I ≈øaid, that the drying up of Euphrates in a literall ≈øen≈øe, can no way ≈øet forward the de≈øtruction of the Bea≈øt and fal≈øe Prophet: and this ≈øuppo≈øition doth ≈øpring from another, which many interpreters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver as an undeniable truth too, to wit, that the Bea≈øt and fal≈øe Prophet are the adequate object of all the vials; when as it is mo≈øt manife≈øt, that the la≈øt vial doth as immediately concerne the re≈øt of the world, as that part under the Bea≈øt: as well the Kings of the whole world, and their ≈øubjects, as the Bea≈øt and his. And very probable it is, that the ≈øecond, third, and fourth vials do belong to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers al≈øo, be≈øides the wor≈øhippers of the Bea≈øt; and therefore though the fir≈øt and fifth vials be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to the Bea≈øt &amp; his dominions, yet I ≈øee

Yea I am per≈øwaded, that if the drying up of Euphrates doth ≈øet forth the plague of the ≈øixth vial, this plague ≈øhall more neerly concerne ≈øome other country, than that where the Bea≈øt inhabits. For as I nothing doubt the literall accompli≈øhment of the drying up of Euphrates, ≈øo, if the≈øe words do ≈øet forth the plague of the ≈øixt vial, I beleeve al≈øo, that no other allegoricall and figurative ≈øen≈øe of the words is ≈øo likely to be here implyed with the literall, as that which Mr<note n="(k)" place="margin">Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                     <p>Now the≈øe frivolous, raw, and ra≈øh exceptions being thus remov'd, I come to that interpretation ≈øo commonly received, and ≈øo much preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fore≈øaid ≈øen≈øe of Euphrates, and the Kings of the Ea≈øt, and it is this.</p>
                     <p>By the drying up of Euphrates (≈øay they) is ≈øet forth the decay of the riches, glory, and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Roman See, the profits which were wont to come from the Countries, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes round about, being (for the mo≈øt part) taken away: by meanes whereof the Kings of the Ea≈øt, that is, the Chri≈øtian Kings and profe≈ø≈øors of the truth, whom God ≈øhall ≈øtirre up again≈øt her in the≈øe parts, ≈øhall have a notable advantage to bring her to ruine. And the ground of all this is that in the 17. chap. of the <hi>Rev.</hi> at the 16. ver≈ø. where 'tis ≈øaid, that the ten hornes (which are ten Kings, who were for a time to give their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome unto the Bea≈øt, with whom in one houre
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:119829:60"/>they received power as Kings) <hi>≈øhall hate the whore and make her de≈øolate, and naked, and eate her fle≈øh, and burne her with fire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But unle≈ø≈øe the abettors of this interpretation will deny, that the ≈øeven vials do containe ≈øeven di≈øtinct plagues; which are ≈øucce≈ø≈øively to begin at the powring out of their particular vials, and not before (and this were to contradict the Holy Gho≈øt, who hath left upon record, ≈øeven ≈øeverall de≈øcriptions of ≈øeven different plagues) unle≈ø≈øe they will do this, I ≈øay, they can never prove the decay of the Popes revenues to be the meaning of the drying up of Euphrates. For ≈øeeing that the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement of the Antichri≈øtian profits, mu≈øt needs be an act of equall ≈øtanding with the reformation of the Church under the Prote≈øtant Princes; and that the beginning and continuance of that work, is a≈øcribed by the fore≈øaid Expo≈øitors to all the former vials (and ≈øurely if this be the time of the vials, experience tels us, that the reformation of religion pertaines to mo≈øt of them) I ≈øay, ≈øeeing the≈øe things are ≈øo, it nece≈ø≈øarily followes, that the drying up of Euphrates in this ≈øen≈øe, cannot po≈ø≈øibly be the proper event of the ≈øixt vial, where onely it is mentioned; but mu≈øt be a thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to al, or mo≈øt of the fir≈øt ≈øix vials, the con≈øum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and perfection whereof is to be referred to the ≈øixth vial; and the beginning and augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to the re≈øt.</p>

                     <p>But the expedition ≈øpoken of under the ≈øixth vial, is to be made by the Bea≈øt &amp; fal≈øe Prophet, again≈øt the Kings of the Ea≈øt, &amp; not by the≈øe again≈øt them, &amp; their perdition ≈øhal be per≈øonal, &amp; final, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing immediately from Chri≈øt him≈øelf. <hi>For they ≈øhall be taken, and ca≈øt alive into a lake of fire, burning with brim≈øtone, and the remmant ≈øhall be ≈ølaine, Rev.</hi> 19. at <hi>the</hi> 20. and 21. <hi>ver.</hi> And what is an utter perdition, what an everla≈øting de≈øtruction, if to be ca≈øt into hell be not? and to whom is this<note n="(m)" place="margin">

                     <p>Thirdly, if the ≈øucce≈ø≈øe of the ten Kings again≈øt the fal≈øe Prophet belongs to any vial, it mu≈øt be to the fift, and not to the ≈øixt: to the fift, I ≈øay, which is to be powred out on the very ≈øeat of the Bea≈øt: for what is the ≈øeat of the bea≈øt, but the great City, which in Saint <hi>Johns</hi> dayes<note n="(n)" place="margin">

                     <p>Fourthly, and la≈øtly, it is much to be doubted, that the ten Kings ≈øhall help make up that great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which is to be gathered again≈øt the Kings of the Ea≈øt. For,</p>
                     <p>Fir≈øt, it being apparent that they cannot be Kings of the Ea≈øt, how can they be excluded from being a part of the Kings of the earth, and of the whole world? for though there be not expre≈ø≈øe mention of the ten Kings, at the gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the great Army, yet there is expre≈ø≈øe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of per≈øwading the a≈ø≈øi≈øting kings to battell by ≈øuch a cur≈øed and dete≈øtable cour≈øe, as would be

Now if they ≈øhould be taken in the fir≈øt ≈øen≈øe; then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe the Nations, <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> are to compa≈ø≈øe the tents of the Saints about, and the <hi>beloved City,</hi> we mu≈øt grant, That all the Chri≈øtian, or at lea≈øt all the Prote≈øtant Nations (which po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe many large Dominions, whereof ≈øome are ≈øevered from the re≈øt, by great and wide ≈øeas) ≈øhall yet at la≈øt be all inviron'd by their enemies; which is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, if not impo≈ø≈øible. And becau≈øe the Saints adver≈øaries are to <hi>come from the foure quarters of the earth,</hi> we mu≈øt grant al≈øo, that the Kingdomes where the≈øe Chri≈øtians inhabite, are no part of the foure quarters of the earth; which were to ≈øwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low an apparent untruth.

                     <p>Fir≈øt, it is evident, that <hi>the faithfull City, the holy City, the City of God;</hi> are ≈øeverall periphra≈øes and individuall expre≈ø≈øions of <hi>Jeru≈øalem.</hi> And why then ≈øhould not the beloved City be ≈øo too? ≈øeeing the Epithet <hi>[beloved]</hi> may well be applied to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ru≈øalem,</hi> which hath all the former titles: but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in rea≈øon be given to the Cities of the<note n="(h)" place="margin">

                     <p>Secondly, we finde in the 11. <hi>chap.</hi> of the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyp≈øe,</hi> that <hi>Jeru≈øalem</hi> is intitled, <hi>the holy City,</hi> in a prophecy, which concernes the very time of its de≈øolation; this pre≈øent time, wherein it is<note n="(i)" place="margin">

                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Jeru≈øalem</hi> is by ancient Geographers termed the Navell or Center of the habitable earth: Yea, it is ≈øaid in the fifth of <hi>Ezek.</hi> at the 5. <hi>ver≈ø. This is Jeru≈øalem, I have ≈øet it in the mid≈øt of the Nations and Countries round about her.</hi> And where but neere the mid≈øt of the earth can that City be, <hi>which the Nations of the foure quarters of the earth ≈øhall be≈øet?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, and la≈øtly, In a prophecy which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporates with this (and ≈øuch prophecies doe be≈øt expound each other) it is thus written. <hi>Out of Zion ≈øhall go forth the Law, and the Word of the Lord from Jeru≈øalem,</hi> and therefore by the <hi>[Beloved City]</hi> here, <hi>Jeru≈øalem</hi> mu≈øt needs be under≈øtood. Now the fore≈øaid prophecy is delivered by <hi>I≈øaiah</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the ≈øecond <hi>chap.</hi> and by <hi>Micah</hi> at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the 4. <hi>chap.</hi> And as the title and ≈øuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcription in <hi>I≈øaiah,</hi> doth infallibly prove the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall interpretation of the prophecy: So doth the ≈øubject thereof, the impo≈ø≈øibility of its accompli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, untill the things fore≈øhewne here by Saint <hi>John,</hi> ≈øhall come to pa≈ø≈øe: to wit, untill the ≈øhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up of Satan a thou≈øand yeeres, and the living and reigning of the Saints with Chri≈øt all that time. For ≈øeeing Satan is to bee bound up for no other end but this, That he may not deceive the Nations; and ≈øeeing, that when he mu≈øt be loo≈øed
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:119829:67"/>againe, he ≈øhall pre≈øently deceive the Nations: it nece≈ø≈øarily followes, that no other time, but the time of Satans impri≈øonment, can concurre with that pious and peaceable condition of the world which <hi>I≈øaiah</hi> ≈øpeakes of: heare his words. <hi>It ≈øhall come to pa≈ø≈øe in the la≈øt dayes,</hi> ≈øaith he, <hi>that the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the Lords hou≈øe ≈øhall be e≈øtabli≈øhed in the top of the mountaines, and ≈øhall be exalted above the hils, and all Nations ≈øhall flow unto it.

                     <p>Thirdly, and la≈øtly, it is point blank again≈øt the text, to hold, that any of them which ≈øhall be ≈ølaine by Antichri≈øt, are to ≈øuffer after Chri≈øts thou≈øand yeares reigne. For although it is ≈øaid, <hi>that the Saints ≈øhall be compa≈ø≈øed about by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which Satan ≈øhall deceive, when the thou≈øand yeares are fulfilled;</hi> yet there is no mention of the death of any of the Saints, but onely of an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary and ≈øudden de≈øtruction of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                     <p>And ≈øo it is plaine, that the≈øe Antimillinarian con≈øequences doe all cro≈ø≈øe the text. And of the ≈øame colour and ≈øutable unto their fancy of the thou≈øand yeares reigne; is the application of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> in the 20. of the <hi>Rev.</hi> to the Pope and the Turke both, as ≈øome; or to the Turke onely, as others of them interpret it. For we read not, that <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> are to make warre a≈øunder, in ≈øeverall parts of the world, as the Pope and Turke doe. Nor that their warre is to be a long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed warre, in which many battels are to be fought, and new ≈øupplies rai≈øed one after another to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it, as it is in the Popes and Turkes wars. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe we reade, that onely one particular Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, or a few, or many Nations are comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the≈øe words; but all the Nations, even the Nations of the foure quarters of the earth: who as they are ≈øpeedily, and at once, to be drawne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether again≈øt the Saints, by the procurement of the Devill, ≈øo they are even in a moment to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne by the power of God, by <hi>≈øire ≈øent downe from God out of Heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And whereas the Antimillinarians would have this <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> to contemporate with the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:119829:72"/>in <hi>Armageddon,</hi> it cannot be. For ≈øeeing the Bea≈øt and fal≈øe Prophet are mentioned as partners with Satan, in the gathering together of the army which is to be de≈øtroyed in <hi>Armageddon,</hi> it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unlikely, that they ≈øhould have been here left out, and none but Satan ≈øpoken of, if this <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> were to be under≈øtood of the ≈øame ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. And that which doth confirme this, and which I would have all Antimillinarians to lay to heart, is becau≈øe the de≈øtruction of this <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> doth follow after that battell, which is to be in <hi>Armageddon,</hi> as well in the order of its execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as in the order of its Revelation. For in the 10. <hi>ver≈ø.</hi> of the 20. <hi>chap.</hi> of the <hi>Rev.</hi> it is ≈øaid, <hi>That the Devill which deceived them, was ca≈øt into the lake of fire and brim≈øtone, where the Bea≈øt and fal≈øe Prophet are,</hi> that is, are to be, when Satan ≈øhall be ca≈øt in thither to them, and con≈øequently, they are to be there before him. Which ≈øhould not be true, if the de≈øtruction of this <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> and of the army in <hi>Armageddon</hi> were all one; for then they ≈øhould be ca≈øt in all together, (≈øeeing the ca≈øting in of Satan at the de≈øtruction of this <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> is as expre≈ø≈øely delivered, as the ca≈øting in of the Bea≈øt and fal≈øe Prophet is, at the de≈øtruction of the army in <hi>Armageddon:</hi>) or if none ≈øhould be ca≈øt in thither, till the la≈øt judgement, who were ≈øo likely to leade the way to the place of eternall torment, as he for whom that burning lake was chiefely<note n="(p)" place="margin">

                     <p>This then being undeniable, that the Bea≈øt and fal≈øe Prophet are to be in the lake of fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtone, before Satan ≈øhall be ca≈øt in thither: who dares define, that the time betwixt the ca≈øting in
