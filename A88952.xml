            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Word of God grew mightily and prevailed.</hi> And it is not to be doubted, but that God will have the victory in the end: and the longer, and more eagerly any truth of his hath beene oppoſed and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt, the more ſuddenly and more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſhall ſhe breake forth againe, to the amazement and confuſion of her Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb facs="tcp:119829:6"/>and the ratification and rejoycing of her ſelfe and her profeſſours. It is yeelded that this Tenet was Chriſtned in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and pureſt times: and that it had no meane Abettours for ſome ages after. And ſurely, a part thereof (and that ſuch a part which is a principal member of the whole) hath found beleevers amongſt the moſt learned of all times. But unleſſe the Sunne ſhould depart, there could be no night: and unleſſe this and many other Apoſtolicall truthes and cuſtomes, had by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle loſt their credit in the Church, That man of ſin, That ſonne of perdition, That blinde leader of the blinde, could never with his trickes and trumpery have gained ſuch acceptance and advancement amongſt men. And therefore I ſuppoſe, that that which was at firſt a good advantage to him in his riſing, and which is now his beſt plea for the upholding of his pompous Clergy, of his Princely and Magiſtracy-maſtering Pontiffes; was, and is, the renouncing of the foreſaid truth, and thereupon the miſ-application of all thoſe revelations which properly and naturally concerne the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and Reſtauration of the Jewes poſterity and Principality. So unhappily, ſo unwittingly may even good men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend, and make way for the cauſe they hate, when they faile to divide the Word of
<pb facs="tcp:119829:6"/>God aright; when they rob the Jew, the more to enrich the Gentile. Let us beware then, leſt our unbeleefe of the Jewes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption (of their<note n="(g)" place="margin">

The truth is, both Jew and Gentile are ſick in the ſame diſeaſe; as well the one, as the other would faine ingroſſe the benefits of the Meſſias ſeverally to himſelfe; whereas they belong indeed firſt and chiefely to the Jew; but onely, to neither. And never will the happineſſe of either receive perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (never ſhall they have full poſſeſſion of the gifts and graces which Chriſt hath purchaſed for them) till both are folded together, till the time come, that<note n="(i)" place="margin">

                  <p>Another reaſon which makes for our Apoſtles, is the anſwer our Saviour gave the ſons of <hi>Zebedee,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 20.21, 22.</note> when they beſought him, <hi>that one might ſit on his right hand, and the other on his left in his Kingdome,</hi> or as Saint <hi>Marke</hi> paraphraſeth it,<note place="margin">Chap. 10.37.</note> 
                     <hi>in his glory; Ye know not,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>what ye aske:</hi> this reproofe you will grant, goes neerer to the quicke, than that before uſed to the Apoſtles; and yet if you marke what followes, you ſhall find that the matter of their petition is allowed of, and only the motives there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of condemned, to wit, their ambition in ſeeking the higheſt roome, and their unadviſedneſſe in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, that Chriſt could then give that to any. which none could have but <hi>they for whom it was,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 20.23.</note> from all eternity, <hi>prepared of his Father.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing this is all, that theſe two were rebuked for by ſuch a ſharpe reply, how can we miſtruſt that more than this ſhould be included in a milder an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer?</p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:119829:11"/>
                  <p>Thus farre wee have argued Topically, and by way of probabilitie, but that which ſeemes to mee clearly to quit our Apoſtles from error, though not from oblivion: from errour, I ſay, in the ſubject, though not in the circumſtance; in the thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, though not in the ſeaſon of its perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance; is becauſe I find my text to be a leſſon read to them by our Saviour before his paſſion. For ſpeaking of the deſtruction of the Jews, <hi>They ſhal fal,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>by the edge of the ſword, &amp; ſhall be led away cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive into all Nations, and Hieruſalem ſhall be trodden downe of the Gentiles, untill the time of the Gentiles be fulfild. Luk.</hi> 21. the 24. verſ. and at the 28. verſ. (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving before ſhewne what ſignes ſhould immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foregoe his appearing) he left them this cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: <hi>When theſe things begin to come to paſſe, then looke up, and lift up your heads, for your redemption draweth nigh.</hi> Behold here, beloved, the caſting away of Gods people for a time, which wee ſee at this day verified: and their receiving againe for ever, which ſhall as certainly come to paſſe, plainly foretold, the redemption, I ſay, not onely of their ſoules, from the bondage of ſinne, to the favour of God, by the profeſſion of the Goſpel, but conſequently of their bodies too, from their general captivitie to the repoſſeſſing of their country, by a miraculous deliverance: for if no more ſhould be meant by the word <hi>[Redemption]</hi> but the meere converſion of the Jewes in thoſe places where now they live; it cannot be conceived, why this action ſhould be accompanied with ſuch wonderfull tokens, and perplexity of all other Nations, as is here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: unleſſe wee ſhall admit no ſpace of time betwixt this converſion, and that inſtant in which our Saviour ſhall give ſentence on the dead; which I ſuppoſe few or none will yeeld to, and if you
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119829:12"/>ſeriouſly conſider the evidence of the Prophets, I am confident you will confeſſe, that a moſt righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and flouriſhing eſtate of the Jewes in their owne land, muſt of neceſſity diſtinguiſh the time of their calling, and the worlds diſſolution at the laſt judgement.</p>

                           </gap>.</hi> But it matters not much, which of the two is here ſpoken of: for ſeeing the Prophet doth plainely ſhew a future reſtoring of the Jewes, and yet the intent of the Apoſtle was onely to prove, that God had then called the Gentiles: it cannot otherwiſe be, but that the words [After this] in the Prophecy, being applyed to the foreſaid viſiting of the Gentiles by the Preaching of the Goſpell, muſt needes conclude; that the extraordinary reſtauration of the Jewes, foreſhewne by the Prophet, was to follow the calling of the Gentiles then begun by the Apoſtles: And conſequently, that the Jewes endevour to (1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2 v. 14, 15.) hinder the growth of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, was a ſure proofe of the converſion of the Gentiles, and their owne rejection. Who unto the death of Chriſt, were the peculiar people of God, and not wholly caſt off, untill by their wilfull unbeliefe, they forced the Apoſtles to (<hi>Act.</hi> 13. v. 44, 45, 46.) turne from them to other Nations, to whom God had not formerly revealed himſelfe, and therefore could not at that time be ſaid, [to Returne] unto the Gentiles, whom he had but then received: no, nor to the Jewes, whom he had then (and not till then) quite forſaken. So that if we conſider the [Returning] of God here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Prophecy, to be appliable onely to the Jewes, to whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone God had ſo long before made himſelfe knowne; and yet that the Jewes were ſhortly after the calling of the Gentiles quite forſaken, we muſt needs grant, that their great happineſſe here foretold hath not beene yet enjoyd, but ſhall be, when the fulneſſe of the ſuccedaneous Gentiles is come in. And wherefore did the Apoſtle change the Prophets, <hi>In that day will I raiſe up,</hi> into, <hi>After this I will returne and build?</hi> Wherfore, I ſay, did he, or rather the Holy Ghoſt in him, make choyce of this Paraphraſe in place of the Text? if not of purpoſe to make that which hath been ſaid, the more planely appeare. To wit, that the day of the Jews deliverance, is to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wait the accompliſhment of the ſurrogated Gentiles vocation. For though this conſolatory Prophecy, according to the order of the things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to the Prophet, hath relation onely to a foregoing judgement de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt the Jewes, yet it is not therefore miſ-inferred here by the Apoſtle, as a ſubſequent too of the anticipated converſion of the Gentiles, and that becauſe the very ſame time, which was foreappointed by God, for the execution of that puniſhment upon the forſaken Jewes, was alſo foreappointed by him, to be the time for the promulgation of his mercy, towards the ſubſtituted Gentiles; as theſe next words, <hi>That the reſidue of men might ſeeke after the Lord, and all the Gentiles upon whom my name is called,</hi> doe moſt clearely intimate. For what is meant by the <hi>[Reſidue of men]</hi> but the remainder of thoſe Nations, which are not to be converted, till the foreſaid redemption of the Jewes? (their Redemption, I ſay, as well out of all Countries into which they are ſcattered, and from all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons amongſt whom (as was foretold) they have beene ſifted (ſo many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares) as from all their ſinnes, which moved God to uſe ſuch ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity towards them.) And what by the <hi>[Gentiles on whom Gods name is called]</hi> but the remuant of thoſe Nations, which are now already (or ſhall, if any more ſhall) while <hi>Davids Tabernacle layes waſte,</hi> become the people of God in the hardned Jewes ſtead? So that this Prophecy doth as well prove a profeſſion of the Goſpell, by a great part of the Gentiles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Jewes deliverance, and in the time of their blindneſſe, as by all that are left of them afterwards; for that by a people on whom Gods name is called, or which is called by Gods Name, is to be underſtood, a people beloved of God, and called out from other Nations to ſerve him, as the Jewes were heretofore, and as the Chriſtians are now, I thinke none will deny; or that by the <hi>Reſidue of men, and all the Gentiles upon whom Gods name is called,</hi> all other Nations beſides the Jewes are meant. And was there then ever as yet ſuch an unanimous conſent in the true worſhip of God, betwixt the Jewes and all other Nations as is here foretold? ſurely never betwixt them and any one Nation. No, nor long betwixt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and (the more the pitty) no leſſe oddes hath a long time beene, and ſtill is amongſt Chriſtians, both in their opinion and practiſe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious duties. <hi>Vide Commentationum Apocalyp. partem primam de ſigillis,</hi> pag. 55, 56,</note>

                  <p>I know the moſt of theſe Prophecies are chiefly interpreted of the joyning together of the Jewes &amp; Gentiles in one Church, and rightly: but to ſay, that this is now fulfilled, in the time of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:119829:28"/>Gentiles Vocation, is to overthrow what was before affirmed, and to take great paines to beguile our ſelves and others of the Truth: It is, I ſay, to put out our owne eyes, and bid others follow us.

And therefore the calling of theſe, can no more be accounted a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Jewes, then the calling of thoſe Gentiles, which were gathered to the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſts Nativity, can be taken for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Gentiles.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:119829:29"/>they are a part of thoſe Prophecies, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the Jewes deliverance, and therefore can have no relation to the calling of the Gentiles. And beſides, is there no hurt nor deſtruction in all the Chriſtian world, that we ſhould thus flatter our ſelves with ſuch vaine fancies? or rather, when was there none? or where is the Nation, ſhall I ſay, or the City, yea, the Village, amongſt us, where cruelty is not practiſed, where ſuch miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes are not to be found, as can ſcarcely be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleled, in the common wealths of the moſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Heathen? And as for thoſe words; <hi>For the Earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the Lord,</hi> which ſeeme to have beene the occaſion of the former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, in my conceit, they imply but this, that therefore God will reſtore to theſe creatures their primitive obedience, and cauſe them to be no more offenſive to his people; becauſe he hath determined to make himſelfe at that time ſo well knowne over all the earth, that his people ſhall no more offend him: And ſo the feare of God, ſhall at once be put againe into the hearts of men, and the feare of men into the hearts of the creatures. For the enmity of the creatures, is but the iſſue of mans ſinne, and therefore when God ſhall pardon the Houſe of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and cleanſe them from all their iniquities (as hath beene ſaid) the ſinnes of men, which are the cauſe, and the curſe of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which is the effect, ſhall depart together. As then there can be no ſufficient reaſon alledged for the allegoricall interpretation of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, ſo, if we beleeve Gods revelations touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Jewes returne, there can be no reaſon ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the contrary, that will force us to forſake the literall ſenſe of them. By which ſenſe I am ſure, that paſſage of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in the 8. Chap. of the

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:119829:30"/>words are theſe. <hi>The Sunne ſhall be no more thy light by day, neither for brightneſſe ſhall the Moone give light unto thee, but the Lord ſhall be unto thee an everlaſting light, and thy God thy glory.</hi> Where, if it had been ſaid, <hi>That the Sunne ſhould no more burne them by day, nor the Moone by night,</hi> as it is in the 121. <hi>Pſal.

And there ſhall be a Tabernacle for a ſhadow in the day from the beat, and for a place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, and for a covert from ſtorme and from raine.</hi> But ſeeing it is ſaid, <hi>The Sunne ſhal be no more thy light by day,</hi> Theſe places will be better reconciled, if we acknowledge, that in the 60. Chap. there is a mixt rehearſall of thoſe bleſſings, which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per onely to the Heavenly Jeruſalem; (which as it is <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. ver. 23. and chap. 22. ver. 5. hath no need of the Sun, neither of the Moone to ſhine in it) with thoſe which the, Jewes ſhall receive at the reſtauration of their earthly Jeruſalem; for ſuch a mixture of things, which ſhall in their execution be many generations apart, is very uſuall with the Prophets. And it is the more likely to be ſo here (not onely becauſe the words immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in both Prophecies, are in ſenſe all one; for they ſhew the ſame reaſon wherefore the Sun and Moone ſhould no more give light unto them, but alſo) becauſe the happineſſe which the Jewes ſhall then be made Heires of, ſhall never againe be interrupted by any miſery. <hi>For the ranſomed of the Lord ſhall returne, and come to Zion with ſongs and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting joy upon their heads, they ſhall obtaine joy and

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:119829:35"/>Chriſt to ſucceed them, as appeares by the ſame phraſe of ſpeech, which is attributed as well to the ſetting up of this Kingdome, as to any of them; to wit, <hi>that it ſhall breake in pieces and conſume all thoſe Kingdomes.</hi>

And conſequently this Scripture proves an abſolute annibilation of the firſt world. Which I ſuppoſe no man will deny, if he doth obſerve when this paſſing away of the firſt Heaven and Earth is to be accompliſht, to wit, above a thouſand yeares after the renewing of them.

One of the ſame A poſtle, in the next Chap. at the 1. ver. <hi>And I ſaw,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>a new Heaven, and a new Earth; for the firſt Heaven and the firſt Earth were paſſed away, and there was no more Sea.</hi> Which laſt clauſe expreſſely affirming an utter abolition of the Sea, doth plainely informe us, that by <hi>the flying and paſſing away of the firſt Earth</hi> (which with the Sea makes but one globe) is meant a ſubſtantiall periſhing of it. Another of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the 8. chap. of <hi>Gen.</hi> at the 22. ver. <hi>While the earth remaineth, ſeed time and harveſt, and cold and heat, and Summer and Winter, and day and night ſhall not ceaſe.</hi> And therefore, when ſeed time and harveſt, and Summer and Winter, and day and night ſhall ceaſe, as it is moſt certaine they ſhall at the laſt judgement; the earth it ſelfe muſt of neceſſity then ceaſe alſo.

And therefore, may not be taken ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, for their regeneration, for the renewing of their mindes, which is to precede their perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (and may more probably be referred to the ſealing of the Servants of God in their foreheads, ſpoken of in the 7. Chap.) but materially and properly, for the quickning of their bodies, when once the number of the perſecuted is fulfilled: whoſe conſummation and glorious exaltation, this viſion did repreſent. It is ſaid alſo, that they <hi>Lived and Reigned</hi> with Chriſt <hi>a thouſand yeares.</hi> But how can it be, that they ſhould reigne immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after their reſurrection; or begin their reigne all at once; or continue it but a thouſand yeares, (which things theſe words imply) if by their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,</hi> ſhould be underſtood their <hi>Regeneration:</hi> and by their <hi>reigne,</hi> their <hi>being in Heaven,</hi> or if by the Word <hi>[they lived]</hi> ſhould be meant onely, <hi>they were converted;</hi> how can they reigne ſo long as a
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:119829:40"/>thouſand yeares, ſeeing the place of their Reigne muſt be on earth? for if they ſhould be any where elſe, how can they be encompaſt againe with war, when the thouſand yeares are expired, as the 9. ver. declares they ſhall? and laſtly, the reigne of Chriſt doth not begin, till Antichriſt is deſtroyed, ſo that a metaphoricall interpretation of the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, would make good this Concluſion, that moſt of the Saints ſhall riſe many hundred yeares before their Reigne; there being no leſſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time betwixt the houre of their calling, and Antichriſts confuſion. The aſſumption is grounded on the 15. ver. of the 11.

Ep. 2. Chap. at the 5. ver. and 3. Chap. at the 6. ver. And therefore notwithſtanding this proofe, the place of his Kingdome ſhall be the earth that now is, though this be not the time, nor any humane policy the patterne of his reigne. And to all ſuch places, that mention onely the diſſolution of the elements and the laſt judgement; I anſwer, that theſe are but a part of thoſe things, which ſhall be done by Chriſt at his next appearing; and that as other Scriptures ſhew onely, that he muſt reigne on earth, and what ſhall be done at the beginning of his reigne, ſo theſe ſhew onely what ſhall be left undone, till the cloſe of his Kingdome, when he ſhall deliver it up to God, even the Father. And in my conceit, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in the very next verſe
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:119829:42"/>doth intimate as much; for having before uſed the word <hi>[Day,]</hi> he warnes them not to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of this one thing, that <hi>One day is with the Lord as a thouſand yeares, and a thouſand yeares as one Day.</hi> As if he had told them, that the Day he ſpake of, was indeed a thouſand yeares: The Holy Ghoſt alwayes uſing it in this ſenſe, when it is emphatically applyed to our Saviours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, or the Jewes Redemption; (which as is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved, ſhall happen at the ſame time.) And though God, as he is eternall, cannot be meaſured by time: And, as he is immutable, feeles no alteration in time: a thouſand (yea ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times ten thouſand) yeares, and one day (houre, or minute of a day) being in this reſpect all one to him: yet this ſhift cannot voyd the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition already given, ſeeing the apparent depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of theſe words on the former, doth cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove, that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> intended not to ſhew what a thouſand yeares, and one day were to God in regard of his nature, (which it is like they knew before) but onely what is uſually meant by one day in the Word of God. And indeed, to what purpoſe had this ſudden and ſerious advertiſement beene inferred, if the Apoſtle did not hereby diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover unto them (beſides the largeſt definite and limited acception of the word) ſuch a ſpeciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a thouſand yeares to one day, as could not belong to any other number? when as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods immenſity and immutability, one day might as well have beene compared with ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times ten thouſand, and thouſands of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, (as I ſaid) as with one thouſand yeares.

To this alſo may be added that in the 24. of Saint <hi>Mat.</hi> at the 31. ver. which ſhewes that when the Sonne of man deſcends, <hi>He ſhall ſend his Angels with a great ſound of a trumpet, and they ſhall gather together his Elect from the foure winds, from one end of the Heaven to the other:</hi> At which time, <hi>Two ſhall he in the field, the one ſhall be taken and the other left: Two Women ſhall be grinding at the Mill, the one ſhall be taken and the other left.</hi> And as Saint <hi>Luke</hi> records, <hi>Two men ſhall be in one hed,</hi>

Who doubtleſſe are not to be left, that the evill Angels may fetch them, for they ſhall be partakers with them of that judgement, and therefore will be as unwilling to appeare before that barre, as they. Neither is it likely, that they ſhall be left, becauſe the good Angels cannot at once aſſemble them to the place of Judgement, and the Elect to meete the Lord in the Aire, if theſe things were to be done at the ſame particular time. And therefore, as I ſuppoſe, they ſhall be left, either to periſh in that generall deſtruction, which ſhall come upon all Nations that fight againſt the Jewes, whom our Saviour ſhall then redeeme: Or to bee eye-witneſſes of Gods wonders in all Countryes at that time.

And we cannot ſay, that theſe which are to be left, ſhall be a part of that army there ſpoken of, becauſe that <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> is to be deſtoyed at the end of our Saviours reigne, that is, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before the laſt reſurrection: whereas theſe ſhall be alive, at the time of that generall diſtreſſe, which ſhall light on the world, at his entrance into that appointed Kingdome, as the gathering together of the elect, who are to reigne with him, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.)

And partly, becauſe we miſapply the infallible promiſes of God, by which he hath ſo freely, and ſo feelingly, ſo often and ſo openly declared, that he will againe graffe them in. <hi>For if we were cut out of the Olive tree, which is wild by nature, and were graffed contrary to nature, into a good Olive tree, how much more ſhall they which be the naturall branches, be graffed into their owne Olive tree?

                  <p>Firſt, becauſe they all ſpeake of a more generall confederacy and combination of the Kings of the world, then hath hitherto beene knowne in any age: by meanes whereof there ſhall bee ſuch a mighty army, as was never yet gathered together in any place, ſince there began to be warre on the earth, <hi>Ezek.

                  <p>Thirdly, becauſe they all declare that the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of this great army, ſhall be in the land of Judea. <hi>Ezek.

                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>7</label> To come then to a direct reply, I ſay, that <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus</hi> ſuppoſeth much, but proves nothing. For firſt
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:119829:59"/>he takes it to be unqueſtionable, that the plague of the ſixt vial, is intimated by the drying up of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates: when as the abominable meanes, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villiſh miracles, which ſhall be uſed for the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring together of the Kings of the whole world, being a moſt apparent taken of Gods fierce anger againſt them that ſhall be thus deluded, and a ſure fore-runner of an imminent temporall death on their bodies, and of an eternall on their ſoules; may, I thinke, well paſſe for the plague contained under this vial: eſpecially if wee conſider, that at the effuſion of the vials, there is firſt mention of the mutation of the thing on which it is to be powred, and then of the hurt and dammage which men are to receive thereupon: to none of which the giving up of people to a reprobate mind (to their hearts luſts, to vile affections) the ſending of them ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhall beleeve lies (that they ſhall even be deceived by the ſignes and lying wonders of Satans inſtruments) is any whit inferiour. Secondly, he ſuppoſeth, as I ſaid, that the drying up of Euphrates in a literall ſenſe, can no way ſet forward the deſtruction of the Beaſt and falſe Prophet: and this ſuppoſition doth ſpring from another, which many interpreters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver as an undeniable truth too, to wit, that the Beaſt and falſe Prophet are the adequate object of all the vials; when as it is moſt manifeſt, that the laſt vial doth as immediately concerne the reſt of the world, as that part under the Beaſt: as well the Kings of the whole world, and their ſubjects, as the Beaſt and his. And very probable it is, that the ſecond, third, and fourth vials do belong to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers alſo, beſides the worſhippers of the Beaſt; and therefore though the firſt and fifth vials be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to the Beaſt &amp; his dominions, yet I ſee
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:119829:59"/>not why the extent of theſe ſhould be made the meaſure of any of the other vials, whoſe effects are indefinitely revealed, rather than of the laſt vial, of which it's well knowne, that it ſhall light heavie on all the earth. Yea I am perſwaded, that if the drying up of Euphrates doth ſet forth the plague of the ſixth vial, this plague ſhall more neerly concerne ſome other country, than that where the Beaſt inhabits. For as I nothing doubt the literall accompliſhment of the drying up of Euphrates, ſo, if theſe words do ſet forth the plague of the ſixt vial, I beleeve alſo, that no other allegoricall and figurative ſenſe of the words is ſo likely to be here implyed with the literall, as that which Mr<note n="(k)" place="margin">Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                        <hi>Mead</hi> obſerves, to wit, the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the inhabitants of that Province through which Euphrates paſſeth.</p>
                     <p>Now theſe frivolous, raw, and raſh exceptions being thus remov'd, I come to that interpretation ſo commonly received, and ſo much preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the foreſaid ſenſe of Euphrates, and the Kings of the Eaſt, and it is this.</p>
                     <p>By the drying up of Euphrates (ſay they) is ſet forth the decay of the riches, glory, and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Roman See, the profits which were wont to come from the Countries, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes round about, being (for the moſt part) taken away: by meanes whereof the Kings of the Eaſt, that is, the Chriſtian Kings and profeſſors of the truth, whom God ſhall ſtirre up againſt her in theſe parts, ſhall have a notable advantage to bring her to ruine. And the ground of all this is that in the 17. chap. of the <hi>Rev.</hi> at the 16. verſ. where 'tis ſaid, that the ten hornes (which are ten Kings, who were for a time to give their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome unto the Beaſt, with whom in one houre
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:119829:60"/>they received power as Kings) <hi>ſhall hate the whore and make her deſolate, and naked, and eate her fleſh, and burne her with fire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But unleſſe the abettors of this interpretation will deny, that the ſeven vials do containe ſeven diſtinct plagues; which are ſucceſſively to begin at the powring out of their particular vials, and not before (and this were to contradict the Holy Ghoſt, who hath left upon record, ſeven ſeverall deſcriptions of ſeven different plagues) unleſſe they will do this, I ſay, they can never prove the decay of the Popes revenues to be the meaning of the drying up of Euphrates. For ſeeing that the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement of the Antichriſtian profits, muſt needs be an act of equall ſtanding with the reformation of the Church under the Proteſtant Princes; and that the beginning and continuance of that work, is aſcribed by the foreſaid Expoſitors to all the former vials (and ſurely if this be the time of the vials, experience tels us, that the reformation of religion pertaines to moſt of them) I ſay, ſeeing theſe things are ſo, it neceſſarily followes, that the drying up of Euphrates in this ſenſe, cannot poſſibly be the proper event of the ſixt vial, where onely it is mentioned; but muſt be a thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to al, or moſt of the firſt ſix vials, the conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and perfection whereof is to be referred to the ſixth vial; and the beginning and augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to the reſt.</p>
                     <p>Neither is it more likely, that by the Kings of the Eaſt are meant the ten Kings which ſhall hate the whore, and make her deſolate: for,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, at the deſtruction of that mighty army, which is to be gathered againſt the Kings of the Eaſt; the Kings that ſhall take part with the Beaſt and falſe Prophet ſhall be ſlaine, as it is foretold

                           <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.27.</note> power com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, but to Chriſt onely?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, if the ſucceſſe of the ten Kings againſt the falſe Prophet belongs to any vial, it muſt be to the fift, and not to the ſixt: to the fift, I ſay, which is to be powred out on the very ſeat of the Beaſt: for what is the ſeat of the beaſt, but the great City, which in Saint <hi>Johns</hi> dayes<note n="(n)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.3.18.</note> raigned over the Kings of the earth? and what is that great City, but<note n="(o)" place="margin">

                        <hi>Babylon</hi> the great, the Mother of harlots, and abominations of the earth? and conſequently the whore whom the ten Kings ſhall burne with fire.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, it is much to be doubted, that the ten Kings ſhall help make up that great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which is to be gathered againſt the Kings of the Eaſt. For,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, it being apparent that they cannot be Kings of the Eaſt, how can they be excluded from being a part of the Kings of the earth, and of the whole world? for though there be not expreſſe mention of the ten Kings, at the gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the great Army, yet there is expreſſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of perſwading the aſſiſting kings to battell by ſuch a curſed and deteſtable courſe, as would be

                     <p>Secondly, it is ſaid, that theſe ten Kings <hi>ſhall make warre with the Lambe, and the Lambe ſhall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome them: for he is the Lord of Lords and King of Kings, Rev.</hi> the 17. at the 14. ver. and how can theſe words be referred to any other warre, but that which is ſpoken of in the 19. chap. of the <hi>Rev.</hi> where it is foretold,<note place="margin">

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:119829:62"/>yet is neither ſaid to warre with the Lambe, nor to be overcome by the Saints.

For if an end of theſe warres ſhould be made by the Lords com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, how ſhould the faithfull have time here to rejoyce, and to give thankes unto God for their greateſt enemies overthrow?</p>
                     <p>But unto the Scripture proofe, I anſwer, That if the naturall (and in ſome ſort neceſſary) acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of marrying and giving in marriage, and of eating and drinking: or of feſtivall eating and drinking (which alſo is in it ſelfe commendable) if the accuſtomed continuance and obſervation of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:119829:64"/>ſuch actions ſhall be a ſufficient witneſſe, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the world of its unmindfulneſſe and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of our Saviours approach (when as there ſhall be very conſiderable tokens, and perhaps too, <hi>Sicut in diebus Noah,</hi> a downe right<note n="(s)" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 19, 20. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 5</note> warning thereof) then much more ſhall the inhumane en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes, and mercileſſe events of warring and fighting, declare ſuch a ſecurity.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I ſay, that though our Saviour did inſtance onely in eating and drinking, in marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and giving in marriage: yet it followes not from hence, that there ſhall be no warring and fighting then. For wofull experience teacheth us, that all theſe foreſaid actions are not onely at this day in the world together: but in many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Kingdomes thereof.

                     <p>And thirdly, I ſay, that we are to conſider what warre is to be at our Saviours appearing; not a warre, in which the enemies of the Lord ſhall fight one againſt another; not a warre in which particular States and Kingdomes, ſhall upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers occaſions bid defiance to each other; but a warre in which the<note n="(t)" place="margin">

                     <p>Next therefore to this Authours Querie, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, firſt, that it is altogether contradictory to the foreſaid Text of Scripture: For if at our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours appearing, men ſhall be found eating and drinking, marrying, and giving in marriage, out of a carnall ſecurity (out of an opinion, that <hi>That Day,</hi> is either<note n="(a)" place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 3.4.</note> not to be at all, or not neere<note n="(b)" place="margin">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God for their greateſt enemies overthrow, (which ever were, and ſhall be, men moſt carnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſecure.)</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I ſay, that this demand is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon a falſe ſuppoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſhall make no ſtay on earth; when as indeed his 1000. yeares reigne is to begin at his next ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, and not before.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, I ſay, that ſeeing the laſt temporall judgement which ſhall befall the adverſaries of Chriſt and his Saints, is to be when the 1000. yeares reigne is fulfilled; and that there is no mention of any ſpace of time, which is to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede that deſtruction, and the ſummons to the laſt reſurrection: Seeing, I ſay, that God is ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in this matter, it is not for vaine man, to faſten his owne fancies on Gods Word: And to promiſe a longer abode to the Saints on this earth, then God hath revealed: And that too for no other end, but to praiſe him for their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:119829:65"/>enemies overthrow; which doubtleſſe they ſhall not forget to doe, nor without great joy performe, when they are tranſlated into that place, where it ſhall be all their employment to magnifie and extoll Gods Name, for all the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings they have both here and there received of him.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, that which doth confirme the 1000. yeares reigne of the Saints in <hi>Judea,</hi> is the expreſſe
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:119829:66"/>mention of the beloved City, in the 9. ver. For ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe words muſt be taken myſtically and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly, for the<note n="*" place="margin">This way runnes the wholſtream of Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. And admit that they were myſtically to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded; yet how ſuch a Church as ſhall reigne a thouſand yeers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, and when the 1000. yeers are expited ſuffer no harme by thoſe that ſhall then gather them ſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her (and onely ſuch a Church is ſet forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, by the <hi>beloved City,</hi> &amp; the tents of the Saints as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent and ſubſequent verſes doe, clearely ſhew) how ſuch a Church I ſay, can be taken for the Church, that now is, which is to continue an afflicted and perſecuted Church, untill our Saviours appearing, I cannot conceive.</note> Militant Church: or literally and properly for ſome particular City. Now if they ſhould be taken in the firſt ſenſe; then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Nations, <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> are to compaſſe the tents of the Saints about, and the <hi>beloved City,</hi> we muſt grant, That all the Chriſtian, or at leaſt all the Proteſtant Nations (which poſſeſſe many large Dominions, whereof ſome are ſevered from the reſt, by great and wide ſeas) ſhall yet at laſt be all inviron'd by their enemies; which is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, if not impoſſible. And becauſe the Saints adverſaries are to <hi>come from the foure quarters of the earth,</hi> we muſt grant alſo, that the Kingdomes where theſe Chriſtians inhabite, are no part of the foure quarters of the earth; which were to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low an apparent untruth. Wherefore ſeeing the conſequences of the myſticall interpretation are no better; I hope wee may the more boldly embrace the literall ſenſe of the words, which, for ought I perceive, doth draw after it no ſuch harſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth doctrines. And in this ſenſe, we may up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on good grounds affirme, that by the <hi>Beloved City,</hi> no other City but <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> can be meant. For,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, it is evident, that <hi>the faithfull City, the holy City, the City of God;</hi> are ſeverall periphraſes and individuall expreſſions of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And why then ſhould not the beloved City be ſo too? ſeeing the Epithet <hi>[beloved]</hi> may well be applied to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> which hath all the former titles: but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in reaſon be given to the Cities of the<note n="(h)" place="margin">

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:119829:67"/>which are no where called by ſuch names.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we finde in the 11. <hi>chap.</hi> of the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypſe,</hi> that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is intitled, <hi>the holy City,</hi> in a prophecy, which concernes the very time of its deſolation; this preſent time, wherein it is<note n="(i)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Luke</hi> 21 <hi>v.</hi> 24.</note> trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den under foote <hi>of the Gentiles.</hi> And much rather then may it be call'd, <hi>the beloved City,</hi> in a prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which concernes the time of its exaltation: the time wherein it ſhall become the royall City of Chriſt, and the Saints in his Kingdome.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is by ancient Geographers termed the Navell or Center of the habitable earth: Yea, it is ſaid in the fifth of <hi>Ezek.</hi> at the 5. <hi>verſ. This is Jeruſalem, I have ſet it in the midſt of the Nations and Countries round about her.</hi> And where but neere the midſt of the earth can that City be, <hi>which the Nations of the foure quarters of the earth ſhall beſet?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, In a prophecy which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporates with this (and ſuch prophecies doe beſt expound each other) it is thus written. <hi>Out of Zion ſhall go forth the Law, and the Word of the Lord from Jeruſalem,</hi> and therefore by the <hi>[Beloved City]</hi> here, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> muſt needs be underſtood. Now the foreſaid prophecy is delivered by <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the ſecond <hi>chap.</hi> and by <hi>Micah</hi> at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the 4. <hi>chap.</hi> And as the title and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> doth infallibly prove the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall interpretation of the prophecy: So doth the ſubject thereof, the impoſſibility of its accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, untill the things foreſhewne here by Saint <hi>John,</hi> ſhall come to paſſe: to wit, untill the ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up of Satan a thouſand yeeres, and the living and reigning of the Saints with Chriſt all that time. For ſeeing Satan is to bee bound up for no other end but this, That he may not deceive the Nations; and ſeeing, that when he muſt be looſed
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:119829:67"/>againe, he ſhall preſently deceive the Nations: it neceſſarily followes, that no other time, but the time of Satans impriſonment, can concurre with that pious and peaceable condition of the world which <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeakes of: heare his words. <hi>It ſhall come to paſſe in the laſt dayes,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the Lords houſe ſhall be eſtabliſhed in the top of the mountaines, and ſhall be exalted above the hils, and all Nations ſhall flow unto it. And many people ſhall goe and ſay, Come yee, and let us goe up to the</hi>

That in it the myſtery of God ſhall be finiſhed, as hee hath declared by his ſervants the Prophets?</hi> And is not this the Reſt alſo, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the 4. of the <hi>Heb.</hi> at the 9. <hi>verſ.</hi> concludes to be yet remaining to the people of God? Surely in my conceit, if the Reſt promiſed to that people, the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> were not to be enjoyed in the<note n="(k)" place="margin">

                     <p>And thus much may ſuffice in anſwer to the Querie it ſelfe. But to make good what hath been
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:119829:68"/>ſaid, againſt all contradiction; we muſt take into our conſideration the thouſand yeares reigne of the Saints, as it is founded upon the ſpirituall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the firſt reſurrection. And becauſe ſome Scriptures urged againſt the oppoſite Tenet, are the onely props of this expoſition, I ſhall by the way, propoſe a ſaying, upon which the maine confidence of the Antimillinarians doth rely; it being taken by them, to be altogether inconſiſtent with a double reſurrection of the dead; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently with the literall ſenſe of the firſt reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. The words are in the 5. <hi>chap.</hi> of Saint <hi>John,</hi> at the 28. <hi>verſ.</hi> and runne thus. <hi>The houre is comming, in which all that are in the graves ſhall beare his voyce, and ſhall come forth, They that have done good, unto the reſurrection of life, and they that have done evill, unto the reſurrection of damnation.</hi> I muſt confeſſe, if touching the matter in queſtion, we had no light but from this preſent text; or that the word [<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

But as we know, that there are many paſſages in the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall writings, which make more for us, then this doth againſt us, (and which ought therefore ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be the meaſure of this, then this of them) ſo we know alſo, that the word [<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>] is of large uſe even in the Scripture it ſelfe. For though it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſignifies that artificiall part of time, which is called an houre, as <hi>Matth.</hi> the 20. at the 6. <hi>verſ.</hi> Yet ſometimes it is metonymically taken for a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous time, as <hi>John</hi> the 12. at the 27. <hi>verſ.</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſynecdochically contracted to a moment, as <hi>Luke</hi> the 12. at the 12. <hi>verſ.</hi> or lengthened to a day, as <hi>Marke</hi> the 6. at the 35. <hi>verſ.</hi> or ſtretcht out to

Againe I finde theſe that agree upon a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares preciſely, very much diſagreeing about
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:119829:70"/>the placing of them, for one will have them begin at the Incarnation, another at the Paſſion, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of our Saviour, a third at the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> a fourth at the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and a fifth confuting all theſe, will not have them beginne till the dayes of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great, about the 300. yeare after Chriſt, and ſome alſo not till <hi>Luthers</hi> time: and yet all of them will have a part of Antichriſts reigne included within the compaſſe of the thouſand yeares reigne, becauſe ſome of them that are to reigne with Chriſt, are particularly deſcribed by their not worſhipping of the Beaſt.

                     <p>Secondly, it is quite beſide, if not againſt the text, to ſay that but a part of thoſe, which ſhall ſuffer under Antichriſt, are to be with Chriſt in the time of his thouſand yeares reigne. For we reade, that S. <hi>John ſaw the ſoules of them that were beheaded for the witneſſe of Jeſus, and for the word of God; and which had not worſhipped the Beaſt, neither his image, neither had received his marke upon their forehead, or in their hands: and they lived and reigned with Chriſt a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares.</hi> Now whether theſe words doe not rather comprehend all the Martyrs, then a part of them: or (which comes all to one reckoning) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhew not alſo, that all of them were to ſuffer, before any of them<note n="(n)" place="margin">

And ſurely, if by <hi>the ſoules of them that were beheaded for the witneſſe of Jeſus, and for the Word of God:</hi> all that were ſlain before the time of the beaſt, (to wit, the ſecond beaſt) are to be underſtood, as<note n="(o)" place="margin">Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum Teſt. pag. <hi>1569.</hi> col. <hi>2.</hi>

And beſides, none of the Saints were to ſuffer, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the time, or after the time of the thouſand yeares reigne, but before it: and conſequently, not
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:119829:72"/>a part, but all of them are to be with Chriſt, when he doth reigne.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, and laſtly, it is point blank againſt the text, to hold, that any of them which ſhall be ſlaine by Antichriſt, are to ſuffer after Chriſts thouſand yeares reigne. For although it is ſaid, <hi>that the Saints ſhall be compaſſed about by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which Satan ſhall deceive, when the thouſand yeares are fulfilled;</hi> yet there is no mention of the death of any of the Saints, but onely of an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary and ſudden deſtruction of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                     <p>And ſo it is plaine, that theſe Antimillinarian conſequences doe all croſſe the text. And of the ſame colour and ſutable unto their fancy of the thouſand yeares reigne; is the application of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> in the 20. of the <hi>Rev.</hi> to the Pope and the Turke both, as ſome; or to the Turke onely, as others of them interpret it. For we read not, that <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> are to make warre aſunder, in ſeverall parts of the world, as the Pope and Turke doe. Nor that their warre is to be a long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed warre, in which many battels are to be fought, and new ſupplies raiſed one after another to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it, as it is in the Popes and Turkes wars.

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:119829:72"/>in <hi>Armageddon,</hi> it cannot be. For ſeeing the Beaſt and falſe Prophet are mentioned as partners with Satan, in the gathering together of the army which is to be deſtroyed in <hi>Armageddon,</hi> it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unlikely, that they ſhould have been here left out, and none but Satan ſpoken of, if this <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> were to be underſtood of the ſame ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. And that which doth confirme this, and which I would have all Antimillinarians to lay to heart, is becauſe the deſtruction of this <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> doth follow after that battell, which is to be in <hi>Armageddon,</hi> as well in the order of its execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as in the order of its Revelation. For in the 10. <hi>verſ.</hi> of the 20. <hi>chap.</hi> of the <hi>Rev.</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>That the Devill which deceived them, was caſt into the lake of fire and brimſtone, where the Beaſt and falſe Prophet are,</hi> that is, are to be, when Satan ſhall be caſt in thither to them, and conſequently, they are to be there before him. Which ſhould not be true, if the deſtruction of this <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> and of the army in <hi>Armageddon</hi> were all one; for then they ſhould be caſt in all together, (ſeeing the caſting in of Satan at the deſtruction of this <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> is as expreſſely delivered, as the caſting in of the Beaſt and falſe Prophet is, at the deſtruction of the army in <hi>Armageddon:</hi>) or if none ſhould be caſt in thither, till the laſt judgement, who were ſo likely to leade the way to the place of eternall torment, as he for whom that burning lake was chiefely<note n="(p)" place="margin">

                     <p>This then being undeniable, that the Beaſt and falſe Prophet are to be in the lake of fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, before Satan ſhall be caſt in thither: who dares define, that the time betwixt the caſting in
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:119829:73"/>of the beaſt and falſe Prophet, and the caſting in of Satan, ſhal be either more or leſſe, then that which the holy Ghoſt hath left upon record? to wit, the whole ſpace of the Saints reigne, and of the little ſeaſon in which the Nations are againe to be ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. And conſequently, the firſt reſurrection is to be literally underſtood. The thouſand years reigne is to be on earth. And this <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> in the 20. of the <hi>Rev.</hi> is to be the multiplyed poſterity of thoſe that ſhall be left of the Nations at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the thouſand yeares, when the army of the beaſt and falſe Prophet, and of the Kings of the earth, and of the whole world (who as the paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel declares, are the <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> foretold by <hi>Ezekiel</hi>) ſhall be deſtroyed in <hi>Armageddon.</hi> And as this doth neceſſarily follow upon the foreſaid text, upon the caſting of the beaſt and falſe Prophet into the lake of fire and brimſtone, ſo long before the caſting in of Satan: ſo it is intimated too, in that at the time of the gathering together of this <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> there is no mention of any Kings (nor alluſion to any eminent perſon or perſons) that ſhall then beare any ſway amongſt the Nations; to whom Satan may firſt and chiefely apply himſelfe, and of whom he may make ſuch uſe in the gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them together, as he ſhall doe of the Kings, beaſt, and falſe Prophet, at the gathering of the firſt <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog.</hi> And againe, it is implyed, in that it is ſaid, <hi>that Satan ſhall go out to deceive the Nations;</hi> by which it appeares, that all the time of his impriſonment they are not to be deceived; and conſequently, they are neither to be ignorant, nor negligent of their duty towards<note n="(q)" place="margin">
